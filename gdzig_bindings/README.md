# gdzig_bindings

These bindings provide a Zig interface on top of Godot's GDExtension APIs.

The design of this library is focused on providing the most minimal interface
possible, while improving the development experience with Zig idioms, type safety,
error unions, and other features.

All Godot classes and builtin type wrappers, except for `Variant` and a handful
of hand maintained types, are generated by the `gdzig_bindgen` tool using
Godot's `extension_api.json`.

The entire `gdextension_interface.h` wrapper is hand maintained for the best
developer experience.
