//! Compatibility shims for zig build-script APIs that changed shape
//! between the pinned stable release and zig master. Runtime-code shims
//! live in src/compat.zig. See docs/adr/0001-zig-version-compat.md.
//!
//! Gates probe API *shape* (comptime `@hasDecl`/`@hasField`/return-type
//! probes), not version numbers, so they keep working across future
//! releases until the old-shape branch is deleted. Discover all gates with:
//! `git grep -E "comptime !?@has(Decl|Field)"`.
//!
//! No current shims — add gates here when stable/master skew appears.
